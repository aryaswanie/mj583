# MJ583 Advanced Interactive Media

Advanced Web programming and storytelling for the Web with focus on data visualization and data storytelling. Students will use learn Python,JavaScript and other web publishing languages while creating interactive storytelling and data visualization projects. Students will collect and incorporate data via APIs, datasets, databases and web scraping along with photos, text, video and graphics to create interactive multimedia presentations using advanced Python and javascript concepts, libraries and frameworks such as D3.js, Flask and Pandas 

This course will expand on the knowledge and skills learned in J586 and multimedia design by increasing your ability to develop and present media, specifically data. You will learn to collect and process data in Python and Pandas and then get  a deeper level of JavaScript and how to use and implement D3 (JavaScript Framework).
